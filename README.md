# DeepLabV3 – CamVid Semantic Segmentation (Colab Demo)

This repository contains a Google Colab notebook demonstrating **semantic segmentation**
using **DeepLabV3** on the **CamVid dataset**.

The notebook was developed as part of MSc-level coursework and research to explore
encoder–decoder architectures for pixel-wise scene understanding in urban environments.

## Contents
- End-to-end semantic segmentation pipeline
- Dataset loading and preprocessing (CamVid)
- DeepLabV3 model configuration
- Training and evaluation in Google Colab
- Visualization of segmentation outputs

## Purpose
This repository is provided as a **demonstration of practical experience** with
deep learning–based semantic segmentation, including model training, evaluation,
and result interpretation. It is not intended as a production-ready framework.

## How to run
1. Open the notebook in **Google Colab**
2. Ensure a GPU runtime is selected
3. Follow the cells sequentially

Some paths and dataset handling are written for Colab and may require minor
adjustments if run locally.

## Data
The CamVid dataset is a public benchmark dataset for semantic segmentation.
No proprietary or restricted datasets are included in this repository.

## Notes
This notebook reflects exploratory and educational work.
Model performance and hyperparameters were selected for demonstration purposes.
